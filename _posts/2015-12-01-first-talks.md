We've been really thrilled by the response to our [call for proposals](http://na.pycon.org/cfp/) for PyCon Namibia - we've received suggestions for talks and workshops from across Africa, and also from Europe and north and south America - Namibia, Nigeria, Zimbabwe, Zambia, South Africa, Canada, UK, Germany, the Netherlands and Brazil!

We'll be publishing a full schedule shortly after we have reached our deadline (15th December), but we can give you a taste of some of the talks that we'll be holding at the event.

You can expect:

* Python in **quantum physics**
* advice on **becoming a freelance Python programmer**
* **development tools** for Python developers
* advanced **websockets**
* Python in **mathematical research**
* how Python is helping meet **African healthcare challenges**
* starting **your programming career**
* help yourself to **Raspberry Pi**
* Python on the web with **Django**

... and there'll be more. We'll be running two tracks of talks, and we'll be aiming to suit interests right across the range of Python topics, and all levels of experience.

We're also going to be holding a number of introductory and advanced workshops with experienced tutors, but we'll announce some more about that later.

There's still time to submit your [proposal](http://na.pycon.org/cfp/) and help make PyCon Namibia better still with your contribution.
