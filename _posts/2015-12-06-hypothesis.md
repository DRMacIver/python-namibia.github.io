[David MacIver](http://www.drmaciver.com) is the author of [Hypothesis](http://hypothesis.readthedocs.org/), and in demand for his sought-after [practical workshops](http://www.drmaciver.com/consulting-and-training/) (introductory and advanced) for companies that want to integrate Hypothesis into their array of testing tools.

David will not only be attending PyCon Namibia as a speaker and running a workshop at the event,
but is very generously [donating 50% of his workshop
revenues](http://www.drmaciver.com/2015/12/lets-help-people-go-to-pycon-namibia/) between now and
mid-January to PyCon Namibia.

As an additional encouragement to companies considering holding one of these workshops for their staff, **he is also discounting them heavily** during the same period, to **Â£2000 for a day-long training session** - so now's the chance to book one at this price while you can!

This is a remarkable act of solidarity with the PyCon Namibia project and we're extremely grateful
to David for all of his contributions to it. We are absolutely delighted that he'll be joining us
in Windhoek.

## About Hypothesis

In case you're not yet familiar with it, [Hypothesis](http://hypothesis.readthedocs.org/) has received a lot of attention lately for bringing property-based testing into Python - you've probably heard someone talking about it at a recent PyCon or DjangoCon.

Hypothesis will iterate tests, many thousands of them if required, against your code using randomised data to seek out edge-cases. It tracks failures and hones in on the exact causes by refining its tests until it is able to establish minimal failing cases.
