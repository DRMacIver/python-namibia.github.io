[Django Girls](https://djangogirls.org) is a global phenomenon. Since the first Django Girls
workshop in Berlin in July 2014, a staggering number of workshops have been held around the world,
introducing women to programming in a friendly and supportive environment.

Django Girls workshops are **free** and **open to all women**. No experience is required, and you
don't need to have a background in science or mathematics to learn or enjoy programming.

In Windhoek, Jessica Upani (PyNam chair) will be joined by several other coaches and organisers
from across the world, including Anna Ossowski, Aisha Bello and Katie Barr.

We're extremely excited to have Django Girls with us at PyCon Namibia.

The Django Girls workshop will be held on the first day of the conference alongside other workshops,
ensuring that attendees will not miss any of the talks (on days two and three).

Don't miss this super opportunity. You need to apply for a place at the workshop. More information
is available on the [Django Girls Windhoek page](https://djangogirls.org/windhoek/).
