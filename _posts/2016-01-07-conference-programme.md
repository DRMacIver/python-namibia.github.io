We're proud to present our draft [programme of talks and workshops](/programme).
There will be something - and we hope, a lot - for everyone.

We'll start with a day of **introductory workshops**, including the wonderful **Django Girls** tutorial, followed by two more of talks and a final day of more **advanced workshops and collaboration**.

We have speakers and workshop leaders from around the world - Africa, Europe, North and South America - on a wide variety of topics.

Speakers include leaders of several key open-source software projects, and developers involved in initiatives of international significance.

There'll be talks on Python in **science** and **mathematics**, **web applications**, the experience of **being a coder**, what the international **Python community** is doing, how to develop **your programming career** and much more.

Our two days of workshops will take you from the most basic introductions to advanced programming techniques - at PyCon Namibia you'll learning new skills through hands-on activities.

If you haven't already obtained your [ticket](/tickets), now is the time!
