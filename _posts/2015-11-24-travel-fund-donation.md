excerpt: "A supporter in the Python community has made a £1000 donation to PyCon Namibia, specifically for the purpose of funding travel for attendees from other African nations."
---
One of our supporters in the international Python community has made a personal contribution of
£1000, asking that it be used to help fund the attendance of Python programmers who will be
travelling from other African countries.

We're extremely pleased to have this additional contribution to our travel grants budget, to
supplement the [£5000 from the Django Society](/djangosociety/), as well as financial support from
[Cardiff University's Phoenix Project](http://www.cardiff.ac.uk/phoenix-project/), and will of
course be using it exactly as requested by the supporter.

We welcome support of any kind, including [commercial sponsorship](/sponsorship/) and donations
made through the [ticket sales system](/tickets/).
