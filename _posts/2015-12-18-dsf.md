We're delighted to announce that the Django Software Foundation will be supporting PyCon Namibia
with financial sponsorship.

These funds will help us meet one of our key aims for the event, to leave a lasting educational
legacy that PyNam and the local Python community can build upon for the future.

The PSF's support will be used in part to provide a set of 50 Raspberry Pi computers; these will be
used in conference workshops and other activities, and will be used by PyNam in the future to
continue its [valuable work](/pynam).

This is a great vote of confidence in PyCon Namibia from the international community, and a very sigificant contribution to our goals.

If you'd like to support PyCon Namibia, by sponsoring, speaking or simply by attending, please
see [Taking part](/take-part).
