I. Context A. Jessica McKellar made a challenge aiming at promoting the next Python generation, by one action, until 2015 in her keynote at PyConUS 2014. B. Python for Zombies MOOC is my personal contribution to the next Brazilian Python Generation.

II. What are the differences from the other MOOCs? A. There are a lot of Massive Open Online Courses that teach programming in Python (Coursera, Edx, Udacity), but only 5% of the Brazilian people are fluent in English. B. For this reason, the Brazilian Python community took the initiative to develop the first MOOC to teach programming in Portuguese. The initiative of this MOOC does not come from the University where I am a professor. C. We use Python 3: examples for the benefits of using Python 3.

III. Some data and the history of the MOOC A. Our team consists of three folks with no budget, who counts on the collaboration of the whole Brazilian Python community. B. In two years of activity we have reached the mark of 40.000 enrollments. The course completion rate was 8.91% (higher than the average of traditional MOOCs). C. Some girls that are former students founded the first PyLadies groups in Brazil. D. All material is Creative Commons, and it is used by Local Python Users Groups and by many universities to teach basic programming in Python.

IV. Live coding A. Examples of code made by twelve-year-old girls. B. Hacking basic modules and classes to obtain the "Answer to the Ultimate Question of Life, the Universe, and Everything". A funny way to teach programming.

V. Final considerations A. Personal benefits: 40 talks and workshops at a lot of conferences B. Benefits for the university where I teach: visibility, flipped classrooms, second chance for students to review the lessons C. Benefits for the Python community: "trojan horse" to enter any new university, material for tutorials in local user groups and so many Python Day events based in the popularity of the MOOC. D. Future of the Python for Zombies MOOC: Edx open plataform.

Outline: (5 minutes) Context, personal presentation, general description of the MOOC (5 minutes) Cronology, differences from other MOOCs (15 minutes) Some data and personal stories of the students. (10 minutes) Best part of the talk. Living Code. Examples of code made by twelve-year-old girls. Hacking basic modules and classes to obtain the "Answer to the Ultimate Question of Life, the Universe, and Everything". A funny way to teach programming. (5 minutes) Final Considerations I prefer questions to be asked in private, due to limited time.
