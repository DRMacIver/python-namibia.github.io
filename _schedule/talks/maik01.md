I was more or less thrown into freelancing, but have found it a very comfortable way to work. During the last four years, on average, I have not worked more than two days a week. For a lot of people, it provides a lot of flexibility and independence that is not attainable through a regular job.

I'd talk about how I got started freelancing, what sort of qualities I think are important. I'd also put a special highlight on working remotely, as I suppose that's one way for attendees to find work as well.
