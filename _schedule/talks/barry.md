I would like to introduce the use of Websockets for distributed messaging and
computing. Particularly the interoperability between dissimilar technologies &
platforms facilitated by the use of Websockets.

My presentation will demonstrate the utilization of Websockets to communicate
between clients implemented in the Go language, running on a Windows platform
and a server instance implemented in Python 3 and running on a Linux platform.
Variations on the options for communication will include the use of
serialization protocols such as Message Pack) and JSON both text-based and raw
binary streams.

I would also like to demonstrate the ease with which a simple browser-based chat
application can be implemented using Websockets with JavaScript on the client
(browser) side and Python on the server side.
