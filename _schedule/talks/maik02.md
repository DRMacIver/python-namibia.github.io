A lot of my work is interfacing with outside systems, and Python is excellent
for providing the glue between them. I'd like to give a short intro
(introducing concepts like REST, RPC, JSON...), and then Python libraries to
talk to a few of them. I could then showcase a little example. I saw that the
Google Translate API translates between English, Afrikaans and German, so maybe
that could be a neat example.
