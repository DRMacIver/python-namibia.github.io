I would like to share my Journey with Python so far from a beginner
perspective, and how it was a tool in discovering myself. I would then
transition to tell a story of how a Django Girls event which will happen in
February in Lagos, Nigeria brought about the creation of a Nigerian Python
community and how it might also turn out to be the first gathering of the
Nigerian Python users group I would also speak on how DjangoGirls is creating a
central hub for all Nigerian Python users with the support of PSF, and also to
create more awareness for the Nigerian Python community. Hopefully through this
talk I would reach out to other Nigerian Pythonistas to join the Nigerian
python community to promote Python in Nigeria and also reach out to other
African Pythonistas to garner their support.

At the end of the talk I hope to inspire people not just the python Experts but
to also show them that there is a lot they can do with the little they know and
the resources available to them to not only improve themselves and fuel their
passion, but also how they can help their immediate community. With a finishing
quote "Great things are done by a series of small things brought together."
