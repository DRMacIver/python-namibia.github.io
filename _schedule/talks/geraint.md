This talk will give the story of ASQ (ASQ Simulates Queues), an open queueing
network simulation library.

From its origins as a bit of code that verified basic queueing theory, to a developing simulation
framework library that is being used in real projects. Working on this code has taught me a lot
about coding, development, testing and documentation.

Currently ASQ is being used in two academic projects: A study into deadlock in
queueing networks which explores analytical models of theoretical networks that
deadlock, and the modelling of real world outpatient clinics to assess system
demand.
