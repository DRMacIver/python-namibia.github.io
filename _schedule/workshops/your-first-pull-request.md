This workshop would be a hands-on workshop to submit a good pull request to a
project of choice. I would name a few sample projects for ideas.  I'd talk
about what I am looking for in a pull request, talk about contributing
guidelines, about the right attitude towards getting something from maintainers
often doing this on their free time, looking for duplicate issues etc.  We
could then clone a repo, do the fix, run the test suite or make the docs, and
submit the PR.
