Start by explaining conda: it is a combines package and environment management,
it can replace virtualenvironments, and pip (mostly). Then I will demonstrate
somethings that are easier to do with conda, like installing scipy.

But conda does not just handle package installation, it can also handle package
building. I'll explain this.

And once packages are built, conda can also handle package distribution. Either
directly or through anaconda.org.

And with anaconda.org you get free continuous integration when your packages
are built.
