Learning a programming language is one thing and applying it to solve
day-to-day problems is another. I would like to help Python users apply and use
Python and its various libraries to solve problems in their lives, companies,
schools and communities by being able to identify the problem, propose a
solution, create business requirements and then identifying the possible Python
packages to use for developing the system. I would like to incline more to web
applications using Python and Django, and other libraries as necessary.
