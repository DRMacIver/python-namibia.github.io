The Django Society aims to promote the use of Django/Python and support users and user communities.

Members of the Society have been involved in software community conferences including [Django
Weekend Cardiff](http://djangoweekend.org/), DjangoCon Europe ([2014](http://2014.djangocon.eu),
[2015](http://2015.djangocon.eu)), [PyCon UK](http://pycon.org.uk) and 2015's [Python
Namibia](http://python-namibia.org), and are providing organisational support to PyCon Namibia.

## Grants for travel

The Society has allocated funds of **Â£5000** to provide grants to help international attendees
travel to Namibia to participate in PyCon Namibia.

For details of likely costs of travel, accommodation and subsistence, please see [travel](/travel).

### How to apply

To apply for a grant, please complete the [PyCon Namibia 2016 travel grant application
form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1FalQthYyMzaS7qeCMrNLNw-OEJhGuHgSjIgLdB0LncI/viewform).

Deadline for submissions: end of 15th November UTC. Applicants will be notified of funding
decisions as soon as possible.

Attendees who are giving [talks or running workshops or other activities](/cfp/) will be strongly
favoured. The committee will welcome applications from attendees from all backgrounds and levels
of skill and experience - the grants are open to all, not just to advanced or experienced
programmers.

Please note that funds are not unlimited, and the Django Society will not be able to meet all
requests for funding, or meet every request in full.
