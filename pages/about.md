PyCon Namibia is an initiative of the Namibian Python community - software
professionals, scientists, academics and students, who believe in the power of
open-source software. This initiative is supported by the [University of
Namibia](http://www.unam.na/) and the [Cardiff University Phoenix
Project](http://www.cardiff.ac.uk/phoenix-project).

The community has already been host to a successful Python conference, [Python Namibia in February 2015](http://python-namibia.org). 2016's event will be nearly three times the size, and represents the community's ambitions to establish Python as the language of choice for its growing software industry.

## Venue

PyCon Namibia will be hosted by the [University of Namibia](http://unam.edu.na) at its [Windhoek
Campus](https://goo.gl/maps/KKRcKjPEdts) close to the centre of the city.

Precise details of venues for sessions will be added later.

## Dates

The formal programme runs from Monday 25th to Friday 29th January 2016.
