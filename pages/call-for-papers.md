The call for papers is now open. If you would like to give a talk and/or a workshop please [submit
a proposal](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1rJ3uQSj6-eC9-slrAV1NGhc2BrxgdGzaQBhTX0wsZ-E/viewform).

We welcome your suggestions, and if you'd like to make more than one proposal, please do.

If you have never spoken at a conference, a PyCon is a great place to do this for the first time.
The audience is always friendly and encouraging.
