The call for papers is now open. If you would like to give a talk and/or a
workshop please fill in [this
webform](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1rJ3uQSj6-eC9-slrAV1NGhc2BrxgdGzaQBhTX0wsZ-E/viewform).

If you have never spoken at a conference, a pycon is a great place to do this
for the first time. The audience is always friendly and encouraging.
