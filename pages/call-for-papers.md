The call for proposals will close on the 15th of December. If you would like to give a talk and/or a workshop please
[submit a
proposal](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1rJ3uQSj6-eC9-slrAV1NGhc2BrxgdGzaQBhTX0wsZ-E/viewform).

We welcome your suggestions, and if you'd like to make more than one proposal, please do.

We're interested in Python-related talks on:

* science
* education
* mathematics
* the web, including Django and other applications
* programming techniques and practices
* community
* robotics and hardware
* software libraries and tools
* ... and anything else!

If you have never spoken at a conference, a PyCon is a great place to do this for the first time.
You'll find a friendly and encouraging audience. We're interested in receiving proposals aimed at
people with all levels of experience, and talks and workshops aimed at beginners will be just as
valuable as advanced sessions.
