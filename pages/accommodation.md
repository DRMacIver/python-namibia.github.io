There are plenty of hotels in Windhoek to suit conference travellers. The UNAM campus is in the
south west of the city, near Eros Airport and Pioneerspark.

## Safari Hotel

Many of the conference delegates will be staying at the [Safari Hotel](http://www.safarihotelsnamibia.com), which we've used before.

Rates for conference attendees (*Standard Rooms*, the least expensive) are:

* Per person single, bed and full buffet breakfast: N$838.00
* Per person sharing (twin beds), bed and full buffet breakfast: N$495.00
* Per person triple room, bed and full buffet breakfast: N$380.00

Other (more expensive) rooms are also available; please ask us for a full list and prices.

However, even the *Standard Rooms* are large and comfortable for two people.

Most attendees will want to share a room, so if you're looking for a room-mate, please ask on our [email list](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/pycon-namibia-public).

Please [contact the hotel directly](mailto:reservations@safarihotelsnamibia.com) for your reservation.

We can share transport to the venue, and expect that UNAM will provide a shuttle service.

## Other hotels

Taxis in Windhoek are very inexpensive, so even if your hotel or lodgings are a little further away,
that's not necessarily a problem.

See [Hotels.com](http://hotels.com), [Booking.com](https://www.booking.com) or [Google
Maps](https://goo.gl/maps/bDrBvTrq83v) (note: search Google maps for *hotel*, *guesthouse*,
*pension*, and be aware that it doesn't list all hotels.

## Private lodgings
