The Django Society UK was formed after the very successful [DjangoCon Europe
2015](http://2015.djangocon.eu/).

The Society has some finds available to help support travel **to** Namibia. If
this is of interest to you, please get in touch with the organising committee by
sending a message to [the mailing
list](UK://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/pycon-namibia-public).
